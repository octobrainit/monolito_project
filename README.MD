# Monolito 

this project is a example of __monolitic__ system where i'm studing to implement

I'm using dev environment on wsl, docker only in wsl (The docker didn't installed on windows)
also coding inside a container of docker thats reason you will see the docker compose file

# For run this project (running docker): 

```
    1) docker-compose up -d --build
    2) docker exec -it app bash
    3) npm i
```
# VsCode extensions

If you have a remote extension you could open a dev environment using CTRL+SHIFT+P -> reopen on container
